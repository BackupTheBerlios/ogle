Installation
============

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./autogen.sh' to setup and generate the needed files.
     There are two package specific configure options.
       --with-dvd-includes=path
       --with-dvdcontrol=prefix
     You will need to give there to build. The most common are:
     ./configure --with-dvd-includes=/usr/local/include 
        --with-dvdcontrol=/usr/local

  3. Type `make' to compile the package.

     While building:
                  /usr/i586-pc-linux-gnu/bin/ld: warning: libmsgevents.so.0,
                  needed by /usr/local/lib/ogle/libdvdcontrol.so, not found
     You probably need to upgrade libtool to version 1.4 or bintools (ld)
     to version 2.11 or later. A possible workaround is to add
     /usr/local/lib/ogle to /etc/ld.so.conf or you can add it to the 
     environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH.


  5. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.  There is
     also a `make maintainer-clean' target, but that is intended mainly
     for the package's developers.  If you use it, you may have to get
     all sorts of other programs in order to regenerate files that came
     with the distribution.

For other information about configure or make see their respective 
documentation.
