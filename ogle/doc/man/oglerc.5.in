.TH OGLERC 5
.SH NAME
oglerc \- ogle configuration file
.SH DESCRIPTION
The oglerc file is a configuration file for ogle.
There is one system-wide file in ${prefix}/share/oglerc and an
optional user file $HOME/.oglerc which overrides system settings.
.br
The file is written in XML, with a DTD in an external file.
.br
Look in the system-wide oglerc for available settings.
.br
The configuration is divided into four main groups:
dvd, audio, video and user_interface.

These are the available tags:

<ogle_conf>



  <dvd>
    <nav>
      <defaults>
        <DefaultMenuLanguage>en</DefaultMenuLanguage>
        <DefaultAudioLanguage>en</DefaultAudioLanguage>
        <DefaultSubtitleLanguage>en</DefaultSubtitleLanguage>
        <ParentalCountry>US</ParentalCountry>
        <ParentalLevel>15</ParentalLevel>
        <PlayerRegion>1</PlayerRegion>
      </defaults>
    </nav>
    <device>
      <path>/cdrom/cdrom0</path>
    </device>
  </dvd>

The <DefaultMenuLanguage>,<DefaultAudioLanguage> and  <DefaultSubtitleLanguage>
tags should be set to your preferred ISO-639 2-character language code.
Depending on how the DVD uses these values you might get different
languages when playing the dvd.

<ParentalCountry> and <ParentalLevel> are used by the DVD to choose
what you will be allowed to watch.

<PlayerRegion> should be set to the region the DVD expects to be played
in. An incorrect region might result in that the disc will refuse to play or
show a screen telling you that you have the wrong region.
This setting has nothing to do with the region setting of your
DVD-ROM drive.

<path> is the path to your DVD-ROM drive



  <audio>
    <device>
      <path>/dev/audio</path>
    </device>
    <speakers>
      <front>2</front>
      <rear>0</rear>
      <sub>0</sub>
    </speakers>
  </audio>

<path> is the path to your audio device



  <video>
    <display>
        <name></name>
        <geometry>
          <width></width>
          <height></height>
        </geometry>
        <resolution>
          <horizontal_pixels></horizontal_pixels>
          <vertical_pixels></vertical_pixels>
        </resolution>
        <geometry_src>X11</geometry_src>
        <resolution_src>Xinerama</resolution_src>
        <switch_resolution>no</switch_resolution>
    </display>
  </video>

<geometry_src> tells where to get the geometry from.
The geometry is the size (in millimeters) of your display.
It can be set to "X11" or "user" not including the "".
If set to "X11" the geometry will be delivered by your X-server.
If you X-server isn't set up correctly it might deliver the wrong geometry
resulting in an incorrect aspect (the picture will be stretched in some
direction).
You can set the geometry manually by choosing "user" and filling in
the <width> and <height> tags in the <geometry> section.
Example:
 <geometry>
   <width>400</width>
   <height>300</height>
 </geometry>

this tells that you have a monitor which has a width of 400 mm
and a hight of 300 mm.


<resolution_src> tells where to get the resolution from.
The resolution is the number of pixels (in x and y direction) your display has.
It can be set to "X11", "XF86VidMode", "Xinerama" or "user", not including
the "".
"X11" - the resolution is taken from the X-server,
"XF86VidMode" - from the XF86VidMode extension (if you change
resolution with <ctrl><alt><+/->)
"Xinerama" - if you use the Xinerama extension
"user" if you want to force it manually to a certain resolution.
When set to "user" you must fill in the correct values in the
<horizontal_pixels> and <vertical_pixels> tags.

By using the "user" mode of both the <resolution> and <geometry> you
can change the aspect of the picture and size.
As an example, if you are using a tv-out output on your gfx-card
to show the picture on a widescreen TV the following can be used.
Assuming your gfx-card outputs 720x576 pixels to the tv-out when
you have set the gfx-card to a resolution of 800x600.

 <geometry>
   <width>1600</width>
   <height>900</height>
 </geometry>
The geometry should be the size of your tv in millimeters, the exact
size isn't that important, as long as the proportions are correct.
1600/900 == 16/9 == widescreen tv.
For a normal tv you should use something like 400/300.

 <resolution>
   <horizontal_pixels>720</horizontal_pixels>
   <vertical_pixels>576</vertical_pixels>
 </resolution>
This tells us to only use 720x576 pixels in fullscreen and not the entire
space available on your monitor/desktop.


  <user_interface>
    <bindings>
      <!-- Each binding contains an action and one or more keys.
           The keys are given as X11 keysyms -->
          <b>     
            <action>Play</action>
            <key>p</key>
            <key>KP_Enter</key>
          </b>
      </bindings>
  </user_interface>

Each binding binds a number of keys to an action.
The keys are normal X11 keysyms.
The available actions are the following:

action		default keys	  	description
------		------------		-----------

Play		p			Starts playback
PauseToggle	space			Toggles pause on and off
Stop					Stops playback

.br
  ',', slower, in slow-motion sound will be muted
  'p', play, normal playback speed
  '.', faster, in fast-forward sound will be muted
  ' ' (space), pause / unpause
  '>', skips to the next chapter
  '<', skips to the previous chapter
  'c', resume (if you have jumped to a menu from the movie)
  'f' 'F', toggle between fullscreen and window mode
  'q' 'Q', exit the player
  't', jumps to the Title menu
