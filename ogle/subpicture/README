DVD subtitles tools - by Samuel Hocevar <sam@via.ecp.fr>



* extract_subtitles.c

This program extracts valid subtitles from a .VOB file. The syntax
basically is:

 cat /mnt/dvd/VIDEO_TS/SOME_VOB | ./extract_subtitles 0 > subtitle0.raw

The argument is the subtitle stream ID, it seems to go from 0 to 15.

If your DVD is encrypted, you should use `css-cat -a' instead of `cat'.

If you are planning to implement subtitle decoding in your DVD player,
note that subtitles seem to be encapsulated in private PS data just like
AC3 streams are. If you do not have an idea about PS or AC3, then you
probably don't even want to use these programs.



* subt2xpm.f

This is just a sample Fortran program I did to learn Fortran and mess
a bit with file i/o ... it does not have the flexibility of the next
one, but it somewhat works, for the Leon and the Dune examples at
least. Its purpose is to create a .xpm from the subtitle stream.

Usage: ./subt2xpm infile.raw outfile.xpm



* subt2xpm.c

This is the most useful program ; it reads a subtitle and writes it to
an XPM image ; there should be no problem using the same algorithm in
a DVD player (actually I did it).

Usage: ./subt2xpm infile.raw > outfile.xpm



* sample_dune.raw
* sample_leon.raw
* sample_bladerunner.raw

Those are sample files to test subt2xpm.


Have fun,
